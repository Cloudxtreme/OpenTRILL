The IETF Standard TRILL (Transparent Interconnect of Lots of Links)

Description:
The IETF Standard TRILL (Transparent Interconnect of Lots of Links) will be implemented and developed under an Open Source Initiative. It is the major contribution of a challenging company VirtuOR (France) and the Phare team from LIP6 (France). The first stable version will be available for downloading very soon.


Notice:
The open source project Linux_TRILL_development is actually no more available. We start the actuel version with a fork based on the available version downloaded from (http://wisnet.seecs.nust.edu.pk/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi) and ported to the new linux kernel 3.10.7 for the moment. The improvements of the actual version is on progress.
