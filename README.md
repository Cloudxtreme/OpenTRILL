The IETF Standard TRILL (Transparent Interconnect of Lots of Links)

Description:
The IETF Standard TRILL (Transparent Interconnect of Lots of Links) will be implemented and developed under an Open Source Initiative. It is the major contribution of the Phare from LIP6 (France) and a challenging company VirtuOR (France). The first version will be available for downloading very soon.


Notice:
The open source project Linux_TRILL_development is actually no more accessible. We start with a fork based on the available version downloaded from (http://wisnet.seecs.nust.edu.pk/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi) and ported to the new linux kernel 3.10.7 for the moment. The improvements of the actual available version is on going.
